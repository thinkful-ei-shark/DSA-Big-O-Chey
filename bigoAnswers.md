## 1. What is the Big O for this?

1. O(1) - you call out and take the first result

2. O(n) - you are running through your options before settling

## 2. Even or odd

O(1) - "n" is growing and smaller terms dont matter

## 3. Are you here?

O(n^2) - nested loops

## 4. Doubler

O(n) because you do one instance of the array growing

## 5. Naive Search

O(n) because we are looping once

## 6. Creating Pairs

O(n^2) - nested loops

## 7. Compute the sequence
